**Issue and problem statement**
Exams play an important role in education where schools use to test the understanding of students of how far they focus on their studies and it is very useful to determine whether you are qualified for further studies or entering a working environment. Based on the dataset that was chosen (student performance in exams), there are many factors that need to be considered for analysing the students’ performance in exam. The data was retrieved from one of the public schools in the United States. From the data, there are a large number of students getting pass and few students getting failed. This analysis has been conducted to investigate what leads to their performance in exams by analysing the student performance in terms of gender, race, parents background and test preparation.
Usually, parents are really concerned with their child grades at school on how they are performing accordingly. Same goes to the school which is concerned about the school reputation and student’s achievement. The performance of the students in exams is important for them. But some of the research tells that there are few cases of students who are not performing well in their exams because of their family education background [4]. Good parental leads to good performance in exams. Therefore, parents' level of education also plays a role in this research to analyse along with the lunch type that is being taken by the student. There are a number of students who are not taking their meals properly such as skipping their breakfast or lunch almost in every country. In this analysis, data for lunch is provided to be used.
Test preparation is one of the common things that need to be considered when it's near to the exam period. Most of the students are lacking test preparation and this

will lead to bad performance in exams. But somehow there are few students that perform well in exams without being prepared for exams by just focusing in class. Therefore, this is one of the criteria that need to analyse how effective test preparation before exams can be.


**Objectives of the project**
Three objectives were agreed for this project. Those objectives are:
1. To analyse the student performance in exams based on gender, race, parents
background, lunch and test preparation and which category of student
performs well.
2. To check the effectiveness of test preparation before the exam.
3. To find out the factor of influence that contribute to student’s performance in
exam
